Energy Flow and Nutrient Cycles
   </strong></h2><p class="para" id="import-auto-id1823297">
Organisms such as plants and animals need energy for growth, movement and
reproduction. They get this in the form of nutrients from the food they eat.
The main source of energy for life on earth is the sun. The sun provides energy
to producers that use photosynthesis to grow and become food for consumers.
Consumers include herbivores, carnivores and omnivores. Decomposers break down
discarded plant and animal (organic) materials into simpler substances, which
returns nutrients to the soil and atmosphere for new plants to use to grow.

Food chain
    </strong></h3><p class="para" id="import-auto-id1715960">
A food chain is a series of nutrients and energy moving through a chain of
organisms. Below is an example of a simple food chain in a grassland. The
arrows show the movement of energy from one organism to another.

Food web
    </strong></h3><p class="para" id="import-auto-id1824310">
A food web is made up of a number of food chains. It represents the different
feeding relationships in an ecosystem or a biome. It is usually more
complicated than a food chain because organisms can get their energy or food
from more than one source. The presence of a number of food sources makes the
system more stable. If one organism is removed, the whole system will not
collapse, unlike in a single food chain.

Trophic levels and the Food Pyramid:
    </strong></h3><p class="para" id="import-auto-id1708841">
The trophic level of an organism is the position it holds in a food chain and
depends on how much energy it consumes or produces. The trophic level of each
organism can be drawn as a pyramid starting with the producers at the bottom
and moving up through the food chain.
    </p><p class="para" id="import-auto-id1396854">
The organism at the bottom gives the most energy and needs the least and the
organism at the top needs the most energy and releases the least. Energy is
lost from activities at every level - through heat, egestion, urination and
reproduction (pregnancy and egg-laying). This is why there is less and less
energy as you move up the pyramid.
    </p><p class="para" id="import-auto-id1713843">
Producers, eg. Plants are on the first level, or bottom of the pyramid, because
they produce their own nutrients using energy from the sun and therefore have a
lot of energy to pass on.
    </p><p class="para" id="import-auto-id1826312">
Primary Consumers, eg. Herbivores are on the second level because they feed off
plants
    </p><p class="para" id="import-auto-id550178">
Secondary Consumers, eg. Carnivores feed on herbivores so they get their energy
from plants indirectly and are on the third level.
    </p><p class="para" id="import-auto-id1673305">
Tertiary Consumers, eg. Carnivores feed on organisms below them in the pyramid

Trophic levels can be drawn as a pyramid of numbers, where each level shows the
number of organisms (look at figure 3). They can also contain the biomass of a
population. The biomass is the mass of living organisms in an ecosystem.
