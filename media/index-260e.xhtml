Plants are made up of roots, stems, leaves and flowers. The function of the root
is to hold the plant firmly in the ground as well as to absorb water from the
soil. The function of the stem is to transport the food made by the leaf to the
rest of the plant as well as to hold the plant upright. The main function of
the leaves is to photosynthesize (make food).

Differences between monocotyledonous and dicotyledonous plants
    </strong></h3><p class="para" id="import-auto-id1167819677950">
Traditionally the flowering plants (angiosperms) are divided into two groups,
monocotyledons (monocots) and dicotyledons (dicots). Monocots are the grass and
grass-like flowering plants (e.g. maize), while dicots include the rest of the
flowering plants (e.g. bean). The embryos of monocots have only a single
(mono-) cotyledon (the first leaf) while the embryos of dicots have paired
(di-) cotyledons. Other differences between monocots and dicots are shown in
the table below. Monocots have long narrow leaves with parallel veins while
dicots have broad leaves with net-like veins. In monocots the flower parts are
in multiples of three while in dicots they are in multiples of four or five. In
monocots the vascular bundles of the stem are scattered while in dicots there
is a ring of vascular bundles. Monocots grains have one furrow or pore while
dicot grains have three furrows or pores. Monocots have adventitious roots
while in dicots the roots develop from a radicle.

Most plants are stationary which means that they cannot move from place to
place. Some plants grow really tall in order to obtain sunlight. They need to
stand tall and erect and therefore need to support themselves. They have
tissues present in almost all parts of their body e. g. roots, stems, branches,
leaves. These supporting tissues keep the stem firm and other parts such as
leaves in a favourable position for photosynthesis to occur as efficiently as
possible.

Capillarity involves forces of cohesion (forces of attraction between water

sides of the xylem vessels). Because the xylem&#8217;s lumen (opening) is so
tiny, water will move up by capillary. However, this force is weak and its role
in moving water up the stem is small.

Root pressure is a force that pushes water up the xylem. As water enters the
root by osmosis, it pushes the water that is already in the xylem of the stem
upwards.

Transpiration suction force is a very important force that pulls water up the
xylem of the stem. As water evaporates from the stomata of the leaves during
transpiration, it creates a sucking force that will pull the water up the

Before starting this experiment, try to guess how the dye might move up the stem

3. Put one half of the stem into the jar containing plain water and one half of

insert the stalks without breaking them, it helps to wedge paper underneath the
jars so that you can tilt them towards each other. Tape the jars or cylinders
down onto a tray so that they do not fall over.

Variation:
      </b>
Instead of using one cylinder with water and one with food dye, use two
different colour food dyes (e.g. blue and red). At first the flower will show
two separate colours, but as time goes by the whole flower will show both dyes.
This is because water can move sideways between xylem vessels through openings
along their length. The ability of water to move sideways between vessels is
useful for when air becomes trapped in a vessel, causing a blockage. If you cut
the stem right up to the base of the flower, this will limit movement between
the xylem vessels.

Meristematic tissue consists of small cells that are unspecialized. These cells
divide by mitosis to form new cells that can differentiate (undergo changes in
their structure) and can become specialized tissue (e.g. xylem, phloem,
epidermal cells)
       </li><li class="item">
Primary meristematic tissue is found in the tips of roots, stems and buds. When
it divides new cells are produced which causes the plant to grow longer. This
is referred to as primary growth.
       </li><li class="item">
Secondary meristematic tissue originates from permanent tissue, usually
parenchyma tissue which divides by mitosis. Cambium is secondary meristematic
tissue that is found in roots and stems. When these cells divide by mitosis it
results in the plant becoming wider. This is called secondary growth.
       </li><li class="item">
Every growing season the stem of a plant increases in width &#8211; this is
known as secondary thickening.
       </li><li class="item">
Towards the end of the first year of growth, the parenchyma cells between the
vascular bundles become meristematic and link up with the cambium tissue to
form a cambium ring.
       </li><li class="item">
The cells in the cambium ring start dividing to form secondary phloem (on the
outside) and secondary xylem (on the inside).
       </li><li class="item">
Each year another ring of secondary phloem and secondary xylem is formed, making
the stem grow wider.
       </li><li class="item">
It is not possible to see the layers of secondary phloem but the secondary xylem
are visible. These form rings called annular rings which can be used to work
out the age of a plant.
       </li><li class="item">
As new rings are formed each year, the older rings are pushed inward and the
xylem vessels collapse due to the pressure. The wood in the centre becomes
denser and harder than the wood at the surface and is called heartwood.

The youngest annual rings found on the outside serve its function of
transporting water. This wood is not as dense and is called sapwood.

The light-coloured rings are called spring wood. They are formed during spring
and summer when the growing conditions are favourable. The rings are therefore
relatively thick and light in colour as the xylem cell walls are thin.

The dark-coloured rings are called autumn wood. They are formed during autumn

Investigation - Tree rings and climate change
     </strong></h4><p class="para" id="import-auto-id1167819660195">
Every year a tree forms a new layer of xylem around the trunk. This forms tree
rings, which are visible as circles in a cross section of a tree that has been
cut down. Each tree ring, or wood layer, consists of two colours of wood; light
wood that grows in spring and summer and dark wood that grows in autumn and
winter. Tree rings can be counted to give you a rough estimation of the age of
a tree. Occasionally a tree will form many rings in one year or miss forming
rings in a year. The width of tree rings is greater in years where good growing
conditions occur. In years with droughts or low temperatures, the trees will
produce smaller rings. Therefore, by looking at the tree rings you can get an
idea of the weather affecting a tree in a particular year. Scientists can use
this information to help determine the weather patterns of the past as well as
events such as forest fires, earthquakes and volcanic eruptions. The study of
past events using the growth rings of trees is known as dendrochronology
(&#8220;dendros&#8221; = tree, &#8220;chronos&#8221; = time).
