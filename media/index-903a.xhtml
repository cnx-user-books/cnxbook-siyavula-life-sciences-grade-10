Transpiration
   </strong></h2><p class="para" id="import-auto-id1610874">
Transpiration is the evaporation of water from the leaves of plants. Water is
lost from the leaf through special pores called stomata. Stomata are found on
both surfaces of the leaf but there are usually more on the ventral (lower
surface ) of the leaf. This is to reduce the amount of transpiration that will
occur because the top of the leaf is exposed to more sunlight than the bottom.

This interactive website explains transpiration pull. Plants use the process of
transpiration pull to move water from the soil up into the leaves.
   </p><p class="para" id="import-auto-id1662170">
Heat from the environment causes the water in the sub-stomatal air spaces to
evaporate out of the stomata. This process is called transpiration.
   </p><p class="para" id="import-auto-id1662571">
Transpiration is therefore defined as the loss of water vapour from the leaves
of a plant.
   </p><p class="para" id="import-auto-id1650693">
Transpiration only occurs during the day when the stomata are open. At night the
stomata are closed.

Light
     </i>
Plants transpire more rapidly in the light than in the dark. This is largely
because light stimulates the opening of the stomata. Light also speeds up
transpiration by warming the leaf.
    </p><p class="para" id="import-auto-id1599406">
     <i class="emphasis">
Temperature
     </i>
Plants transpire more rapidly at higher temperatures because water evaporates
more rapidly as the temperature rises due to the increased kinetic energy of
the water molecules. At 30&#176;C, a leaf may transpire three times as fast as
it does at 20&#176;C.
    </p><p class="para" id="import-auto-id1714186">
     <i class="emphasis">
Wind
     </i>
When there is no breeze, the air surrounding a leaf becomes increasingly humid
thus reducing the rate of transpiration. When a breeze is present, the humid
air is carried away and replaced by drier air. So a steep diffusion gradient is
maintained.
    </p><p class="para" id="import-auto-id1627268">
     <i class="emphasis">
Humidity
     </i>
The rate of diffusion of any substance increases as the difference in
concentration of the substances in the two regions increases. When the
surrounding air is dry, diffusion of water out of the leaf goes on more
rapidly.
    </p><p class="para" id="import-auto-id1713643">
     <i class="emphasis">
Soil water
     </i>
A plant cannot continue to transpire rapidly if its water loss is not made up by
replacement from the soil. When absorption of water by the roots fails to keep
up with the rate of transpiration, loss of
     <a class="cnxn" href="">
turgor
     </a>
occurs, and the stomata close. This immediately reduces the rate of
transpiration (as well as of photosynthesis). If the loss of turgor extends to
the rest of the leaf and stem, the plant wilts.
    </p><p class="para" id="import-auto-id1714608">
The volume of water lost in transpiration can be very high. It has been
estimated that over the growing season, one acre of corn (maize) plants may
transpire 1.5 million litres of water. As liquid water, this would cover the
field with a lake 38 cm deep. An acre of forest probably does even better.

This diagram shows a potometer which is used to measure the rate of
transpiration. As the leafy twig transpires, the air bubble moves to the left.
The quicker the air bubble moves the faster the leafy twig is transpiring.

Why do plants need water?
    </strong></h3><p class="para" id="import-auto-id1713652">
Plants need water to maintain turgor pressure. This helps provide support for
the plant as when a cell absorbs water the cell membrane pushes against the
cell wall. The cell is now turgid. If there isn&#8217;t enough water in the
plant the membrane moves away from the cell wall and the cell is now flaccid.
This is when a plant begins to wilt and it will eventually die. Wilting is the
loss of rigidity of the non-woody parts of plants and occurs when the turgor
pressure falls towards zero. Lower water availability can results from drought
conditions, high salinity, saturated soil conditions, low temperatures or
bacterial or fungal infections that affect the vascular system of the plant,
    </p><p class="para" id="import-auto-id1540089">
When the environment is extremely humid (moist) the rate of transpiration is
very low. In some plants, the leaves secrete water onto the surface of the
leaves through specialised pores called hydathodes. Hydathodes are the open
ends of xylem vessels at the edges of the leaves in certain species of plants
such as strawberries and some grasses.
