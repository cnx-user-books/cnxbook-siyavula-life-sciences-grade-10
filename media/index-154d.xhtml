The word support means to hold upright or to give strength
       </li><li class="item">
Aquatic organisms get support from water. Plants and animals living on land
require stronger support systems as air gives their bodies little support
against the force of gravity.
       </li><li class="item">
Animals have skeletons that support their bodies and enable movement to occur.
       </li><li class="item">
In animals movement is brought about by the contraction or relaxation of
muscles. In order to bring about movement muscles need a medium (fluid) or
solid structure against which the force of contraction can be applied. A
skeletal system provides the resistance needed to cause movement.
       </li><li class="item">
Animals are able to move from one point to another to look for food, shelter and
mates.
       </li><li class="item">
The simplest invertebrates have specialised cells and tissues to assist them to
move to and from stimuli.
       </li><li class="item">
Skeletons also have a protective function in that they cushion vital organs
thereby preventing or limiting damage.

Water is about 1000 times denser than air and is a much more resistant medium to
move through, its high density buoys up the body providing support.. One of the
major problems by animals moving from water to land was the increase in the
force of gravity. In order to counter this, animals needed to develop strong
limbs and to adapt the skeleton to support their body weight on land.
