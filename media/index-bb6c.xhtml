Introduction
   </strong></h2><p class="para" id="import-auto-id2524892">
Fossils are traces of organisms which used to be alive. Fossils can tell us
something about the creatures they came from. Hard tissue, such as bone or
shell, is fossilized better than softer body parts. This is to be expected,
since soft tissue is eaten or it decays soon after death, leaving the bones and
shells to petrify (turn to stone).However, examples of perfectly fossilized
soft creatures, like jellyfish, do exist. In this section, you learn about
theories of how fossils form, types of fossils, how fossils are dated, and
fossil tourism. People who study fossils are called paleontologists.

Fossil formation
   </strong></h2><p class="para" id="import-auto-id2524851">
Different kinds of fossils are formed in different ways. Many form by
petrifaction, i.e. turning into stone. The following may petrify:
   </p><div class="list" id="import-auto-id2474582"><ul class="bullet"><li class="item">
Parts of the body
     </li><li class="item">
Sediments surrounding the body. Sediments are layers of material (e.g. sand)
deposited (dropped) by wind / water / ice.
     </li><li class="item">
Cavities (spaces) left by the body.
    </li></ul></div><p class="para" id="import-auto-id2516101">
Scientists have observed petrifaction occurring both in nature and in laboratory
experiments. Minerals(inorganic compounds) enter the body, hardening it and
turning it to stone. Fossilization has been observed to happen very quickly
when high concentrations of suitable minerals were present, and when the
conditions were favourable for certain bacteria which aid the petrifaction
process.
   </p></div>
  <div class="section" id="import-auto-id1592661"><h2 class="section-header"><strong class="title">
Fossil types
   </strong></h2><p class="para" id="import-auto-id2516077">
There are several kinds of fossils. These include footprints, dung, moulds,
casts, permineralised, and trace fossils.
   </p><p class="para" id="import-auto-id2475390">
Footprints, made when creatures walked in soft sand or mud, can be preserved
(kept safe) when the sand or mud dries, hardens and then petrifies. From the
footprints we can deduce the shape and size of the feet and how the creature
which made them walked. A fossilized dinosaur footprint is shown in Figure 1.
   </p><div class="figure" id="import-auto-id2457840"><table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" align="center" width="50%"><caption class="figure-caption" align="bottom"><strong class="cnx_label">Figure 1</strong></caption><tbody><tr><td class="inner-figure"><span class="media" id="import-auto-id2507671"><img src="Picture 0.jpg" height="115" width="141" alt="Figure 1 (Picture 0.jpg)"/></span></td></tr></tbody></table></div><p class="para" id="import-auto-id2334104">
Dung can also become petrified. Petrified dung is called a coprolite. From this
we can deduce what kind of food a creature ate.
   </p><p class="para" id="import-auto-id2334638">
Mould fossils form around a cavity which the organism used to fill. A dead
creature can be buried in sediments. These may petrify, forming a mould around
the body. The soft body of the creature decays (rots), leaving the mould empty.
The shape of the body can be seen from the mould.
   </p><p class="para" id="import-auto-id1517561">
Cast fossils look the same as the original body, except that they are made of
minerals. Minerals (e.g. calcite) fill the cavity inside a mould, making a cast
fossil. A cast fossil of a shelled sea animal is shown in Figure 2.
   </p><div class="figure" id="import-auto-id1738849"><table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" align="center" width="50%"><caption class="figure-caption" align="bottom"><strong class="cnx_label">Figure 2</strong></caption><tbody><tr><td class="inner-figure"><span class="media" id="import-auto-id2471800"><img src="Picture 1.jpg" height="119" width="130" alt="Figure 2 (Picture 1.jpg)"/></span></td></tr></tbody></table></div><p class="para" id="import-auto-id2454819">
Permineralized fossils form when the body of an organism becomes petrified.
Water moves through the tissues of the dead creature and leaves minerals
behind. These minerals replace the living tissue. These fossils can give a very
good idea of the original structure of a dead creature. A permineralised fossil
of a tree stump is shown in Figure3.

on rock surfaces. A film fossil of a leaf is shown in Figure 4.

Radiometric dating
    </strong></h3><p class="para" id="import-auto-id2241668">
Radiometric dating is sometimes used when scientists want to date fossils. Some
elements are unstable and break down into lighter elements over time. Such
substances are said to be radioactive. The original element is called the
parent and the element it changes into is called the daughter. For example,
uranium-238 decays into lead-206. What is the data which scientists use in this
method, and the assumptions they might make when drawing conclusions about
fossil dates?:
    </p><p class="para" id="import-auto-id2228041">
     <b class="emphasis">
Data:
     </b>
A rock has a certain ratio of the parent to daughter elements, e.g. a certain
ratio of uranium to lead.
    </p><p class="para" id="import-auto-id2515193">
     <b class="emphasis">
Conclusions:
     </b>
In radiometric dating, the ratio of parent to daughter elements is compared.
From this the age of the rock is concluded.
    </p><p class="para" id="import-auto-id1941618">
     <b class="emphasis">
Assumptions:
     </b>
A scientist has to make many assumptions in order to conclude the age of a rock
from ratios between elements. These assumptions include:
    </p><p class="para" id="import-auto-id2019935">
The rock must have had only parent, and no daughter, elements when the rock
formed.
    </p><p class="para" id="import-auto-id2507492">
The rate at which the parent element changed into the daughter element is known
from the rate this occurs today.
    </p><p class="para" id="import-auto-id2507493">
For example, if a rock is found containing both uranium-238 and lead-206, it is
assumed that all this lead came from the uranium by radioactive decay and that
the rate at which that happened is the same as the rate observed today.
    </p></div><div class="section" id="import-auto-id1614256"><h3 class="section-header"><strong class="title">
Carbon dating
    </strong></h3><p class="para" id="import-auto-id2336981">
Carbon dating is the only type of radiometric dating which can be done directly
on fossils. However, carbon dating gives young ages, and so is generally not
accepted, except for dating organisms which have been dead for less than about
30 000 years.
    </p><p class="para" id="import-auto-id892093">
How does carbon dating work? All organisms incorporate carbon atoms into their
bodies when they are alive. This stops at death. There are two isotopes (forms)
of carbon. The most common isotope is C12. The other isotope, C14, is
radioactive. The proportion C12:C14 in the atmosphere is known. Both carbon
isotopes combine with oxygen to form CO2 and both are incorporated into plants
during photosynthesis. Therefore both carbon isotopes form part of
animals&#8217; food. The organism dies. The C12 in the dead body does not break
down radioactively, but the C14 in the body does break down radioactively. We
can measure the rate at which C14 breaks down radioactively over time today.
Scientists compare the ratio of C12:C14in the body to the ratio of C12:C14in
the atmosphere. This is the data used. The scientists may assume that the
C12:C14 ratio at the time of death was the same as the atmosphere&#8217;s
C12:C14ratio, and that the rate at which C14broke down in the past was the same
as it is today. From this they may conclude the age of the rock.

Dating fossils by dating rocks
    </strong></h3><p class="para" id="import-auto-id2173451">
For fossils which are believed to be older than 30 000 years, carbon dating
cannot be used, so other radiometric dating methods are used. However, these
methods can only be done on igneous rocks (rocks formed from volcanoes).Igneous
rock cannot contain fossils. Fossils are only found in sedimentary rock. In
order to conclude the date of a fossil the following process is followed:
    </p><p class="para" id="import-auto-id2228007">
The scientist finds some igneous rock which he assumes to be the same age as the
sedimentary rock in which the fossil was found.
    </p><p class="para" id="import-auto-id1608316">
The scientist measures the ratio of parent to daughter elements in this igneous
rock.
    </p><p class="para" id="import-auto-id2515938">
The scientist concludes the age of the igneous rock, as previously explained.
    </p><p class="para" id="import-auto-id2026172">
The scientist concludes the age of the fossil from the age of the igneous rock.

Living fossils

Many creatures which disappeared from the fossil record millions of geological
years ago have been found to be alive still and almost identical to their
fossilized counterparts.
    </p><p class="para" id="import-auto-id2507750">
There are many examples of living fossils. The Tuatara, which looks like a
lizard with a beak-shaped head, disappears from the record 135 million
geological years ago, but is still alive. Lingula, a worm-like creature which
disappears from the record about 400 million years ago, not very far from the
beginning of metazoan evolution, is still alive and shows no sign of
significant evolution from its fossilized ancestors. This suggests that we may
be interpreting the fossil record incorrectly, and our conclusions based on it
may be wrong.

The rock might have started with a lot of Ar in it. The conditions in the past

from radioactivity.
