Concept of an environment
   </strong></h2><p class="para" id="import-auto-id1167819581701">
Throughout history humans have influenced and been influenced by the natural
world. While much of our impact has been detrimental to the natural
environment, we have preserved and protected certain resources that are
important to us. The environment, while highly valued by most, is used and
altered by a wide variety of people with many different interests and values.
Difficulties remain on how best to ensure the protection of our environment and
natural resources, and how to divide the earth&#8217;s resources equally so
that all benefit, and not just a select few.
   </p><p class="para" id="import-auto-id1167819835963">
There are currently many uncertainties regarding the future of the natural
environment. However it is clear that humans have had a role in its destruction
and will be responsible in the future for its conservation. Environmental
problems are becoming more and more complex, especially as issues arise on a
more global level, such as that of atmospheric pollution or global warming.
There is a realization that such complex problems will demand complex solutions
and the participation of all.
   </p><p class="para" id="import-auto-id1167819740666">
The challenge is to find approaches to environmental management that give people
the quality of life they seek while protecting the environmental systems that
are also the foundations of our well being. In order to face these challenges,
students today will need more than superficial knowledge or awareness of
disconnected environmental issues. A multidisciplinary approach to learning can
build upon the strengths of a wide range of fields of study, providing a deeper
understanding of the technological, political, and social options and
strategies for both studying and managing the relationship between our society
and the environment. There will always be tradeoffs and, many times,
unanticipated or unintended consequences.

methane. They absorb much of the energy radiated from Earth and then re-radiate
it back to Earth. The levels of these gases in the atmosphere are slowly
rising. Carbon dioxide is produced when fossil fuels are burnt. Methane is
released by cattle and from rice fields. An increase of only a few degrees
Celsius may cause big changes in the Earth&#8217;s climate, upsetting weather
patterns and affecting the types of crops that can be grown in different parts
of the world. Polar ice caps may melt, causing the sea level to rise.

With the rise to prominence of the issue of global warming, it is important to
discuss the greenhouse effect. The name comes from the everyday concept of a
greenhouse, where sunlight is allowed to pass through transparent panels and
shine on the plants inside. This provides energy to the plants, but also warms
everything inside the greenhouse. With the sealed layer of transparent panels,
the warmth is trapped inside and the greenhouse becomes much warmer than the
environment outside.
      </p><p class="para" id="import-auto-id1167819825941">
The Earth&#8217;s atmosphere functions exactly like this, except there are no
transparent panels. When sunlight shines down on the Earth, most of it is
absorbed on the surface, giving us warmth and energy. Some of the light is
absorbed by the atmosphere before it hits the surface, and a very small amount
of the light is also reflected back off the surface toward outer space.
Additionally, the surface of the Earth releases heat into the atmosphere, such
as can be seen over a road on a hot day.
      </p><p class="para" id="import-auto-id1167819813310">
The greenhouse effect is not limited to Earth. Any planet that has a significant
atmosphere has some kind of greenhouse effect. Venus has a significant
greenhouse effect that keeps the surface of the planet extremely hot, averaging
around 460&#730;C. A probe that was sent to study the planet survived for only
two hours before melting, even though it was designed with durable metals.
      </p><div class="figure" id="import-auto-id1167819654895"><table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" align="center" width="50%"><caption class="figure-caption" align="bottom"><strong class="cnx_label">Figure 2</strong></caption><tbody><tr><td class="inner-figure"><span class="media" id="import-auto-id1167819655827"><img src="Picture 1.jpg" height="340" width="425" alt="Figure 2 (Picture 1.jpg)"/></span></td></tr></tbody></table></div><p class="para" id="import-auto-id1167819640946">
With the reflection of light off the surface and the surface radiation of heat,
much of the energy from sunlight would be lost back to space. Fortunately the
atmosphere acts like the transparent panels from the greenhouse trapping the
heat. Natural gases in our atmosphere called greenhouse gases (such as carbon
dioxide and water vapour) are extremely good at absorbing various kinds of
sunlight. So, rather than escaping back into space, much of this reflected
light and heat is actually absorbed by the greenhouse gases. This has a
significant warming effect on our atmosphere.
      </p><p class="para" id="import-auto-id1167819814998">
Many people associate the greenhouse effect with global warming. In fact, there
is so much confusion, that these terms are sometimes used interchangeably. The
greenhouse effect is naturally occurring on most planets, and it is necessary
on Earth to maintain life as we know it.
      </p><p class="para" id="import-auto-id1167819585168">
Without the greenhouse effect, the temperature of the Earth might be as much as
30&#730;C cooler! That would alter the surface of the Earth significantly,
covering much of it with ice. We need the greenhouse effect to survive on
Earth.
      </p><p class="para" id="import-auto-id1167819667001">
However, there can be too much of a good thing. Human beings have begun adding a
large amount of greenhouse gases, primarily carbon dioxide, into our
atmosphere. This came mostly with the industrial revolution when we began to
burn coal and gasoline, and now many other fossil fuels (such as propane,
natural gases), and even wood, in great quantities. With this increase in
carbon dioxide in our atmosphere, there is more gas to absorb energy. With more
energy being absorbed, the temperature of the atmosphere is beginning to
increase, causing changes within our weather patterns, and other influences on
the ecosystems of the Earth. This is called climate change.
      </p><p class="para" id="import-auto-id1167819647133">
In the past few decades the population of the Earth has doubled to over six
billion people. These six billion people foster a large increase in automobile
transportation; the major source of the increase in greenhouse gases. The
greater population has also required more resources such as land. Large amounts
of forest have been cut down. Trees are one of the most important organisms
that actually remove carbon dioxide from the atmosphere during photosynthesis.
So not only are humans adding more carbon dioxide to the atmosphere, but they
are also destroying trees that would otherwise be helping to absorb excess
carbon dioxide from the atmosphere.
      </p><p class="para" id="import-auto-id1167819612070">
We will not know the full impact of global warming until perhaps the middle of
this century. This is because it takes so long for the full impact to be felt.
You may remember that water vapour and carbon dioxide are a very small part of
the makeup of our original atmosphere (see Module 5, Tutorial 1). So as we add
carbon dioxide from burning fossil fuels there is only a very small change in
the makeup of our atmosphere. In fact it takes a long time for the atmosphere
to mix in the added greenhouse gases fully. Scientists say that even if we
halted the release of greenhouse gases today, the climate would continue to
warm until about the year 2050 as the atmosphere reaches a new stable state.

The map below shows a region of coastline close to where a giant oil tanker was
wrecked at sea. The shallow waters of the coastline provided a rich source of
edible crabs. Oil does not kill the crabs but harm their flesh, making them
inedible and they cannot be sold. Samples of crabs were collected at sites A to
D. The number of crabs is indicated by the size of the circle. The extent of

The Tragedy of the Commons

(AP Environmental Science: Environmental Ethics) from Connexions
            </p><p class="para" id="import-auto-id1167819648778">
In his essay, The Tragedy of the Commons, Garrett Hardin (1968) looked at what
happens when humans do not limit their actions by including the land as part of
their ethic. The tragedy of the commons develops in the following way: Picture
a pasture open to all. It is to be expected that each herdsman will try to keep
as many cattle as possible on the commons. Such an arrangement may work
satisfactorily for centuries, because tribal wars, poaching and disease keep
the numbers of both man and beast well below the carrying capacity of the land.
Finally, however, comes the day of reckoning (i.e., the day when the long-
desired goal of social stability becomes a reality). At this point, the
inherent logic of the commons remorselessly generates tragedy.
            </p><p class="para" id="import-auto-id1167819648780">
As a rational being, each herdsman seeks to maximize his gain. Explicitly or
implicitly, more or less consciously, he asks: "What is the utility to me of
adding one more animal to my herd?" This utility has both negative and positive
components. The positive component is a function of the increment of one
animal. Since the herdsman receives all the proceeds from the sale of the
additional animal, the positive utility is nearly +1. The negative component is
a function of the additional overgrazing created by one more animal. However,
as the effects of overgrazing are shared by all of the herdsmen, the negative
utility for any particular decision-making herdsman is only a fraction of -1.
            </p><p class="para" id="import-auto-id1167819825805">
The sum of the utilities leads the rational herdsman to conclude that the only
sensible course for him to pursue is to add another animal to his herd, and
then another, and so forth. However, this same conclusion is reached by each
and every rational herdsman sharing the commons. Therein lies the tragedy: each
man is locked into a system that compels him to increase his herd, without
limit, in a world that is limited. Ruin is the destination toward which all men
rush, each pursuing his own best interest in a society that believes in the
freedom of the commons. Freedom in the commons brings ruin to all.
            </p><p class="para" id="import-auto-id1167819734603">
Hardin went on to apply the situation to modern commons. The public must deal
with the overgrazing of public lands, the overuse of public forests and parks
and the depletion of fish populations in the ocean. Individuals and companies
are restricted from using a river as a common dumping ground for sewage and
from fouling the air with pollution. Hardin also strongly recommended
restraining population growth.
            </p><p class="para" id="import-auto-id1167819825807">
The "Tragedy of the Commons" is applicable to the environmental problem of
global warming. The atmosphere is certainly a commons into which many countries
are dumping excess carbon dioxide from the burning of fossil fuels. Although we
know that the generation of greenhouse gases will have damaging effects upon
the entire globe, we continue to burn fossil fuels. As a country, the immediate
benefit from the continued use of fossil fuels is seen as a positive component.
All countries, however, will share the negative long-term effects.
