Meristematic tissue
    </title>
    <para id="import-auto-id1167819659584">
Meristematic tissue consists of cells dividing by mitosis. This leads to an
increase in length and thickness of the plant. The primary growth of a plant
occurs only in certain regions, such as in the tips of stems or roots. It is in
these regions that meristematic tissue is present. Cells in these tissues are
roughly spherical or polyhedral, to rectangular in shape, and have thin cell
walls and no vacuoles or plastids. New cells produced by meristem are initially
those of

      <emphasis effect="underline">

itself, but as the new cells grow and mature, their characteristics slowly
change and they become specialised.

Parenchyma
    </title>
    <para id="import-auto-id1167819664504">
Parenchyma forms the majority of stems and roots as well as soft fruits like
tomatoes and grapes. It consists of relatively unspecialised cells with thin
cell walls. They are living cells. They are usually loosely packed, so that
large spaces between cells (intercellular spaces) are found in this tissue.
This tissue provides support to plants through turgor pressure and also stores
food in its cells in the form of sugar and starch. In some situations, it
contains chlorophyll and performs photosynthesis, and then it is called
chlorenchyma

substances at the corners where number of cells join together. This tissue gives
a tensile strength (because of the thickened corners) and flexibility due to
the thinner areas). The cells are compactly arranged and do not have inter-
cellular spaces. It occurs chiefly in

plants. It provides mechanical support, elasticity, and tensile strength to the
plant body.

The main function of sclerenchyma tissues is to give support and protection to
the plant. For example sclerenchyma keeps stems upright and protects nuts in
their hard shells.

Xylem
    </title>
    <para id="import-auto-id1167819540761">
Xylem tissue has the dual function of supporting the plant and transporting
water and dissolved mineral salts. It is made up of vessel elements, tracheids,
fibres and parenchyma cells. These cells are joined end to end to form long
tubes. Vessels and tracheids are dead at maturity. Tracheids have thick
secondary cell walls and are tapered at the ends. The thick walls provide
support. They do not have end openings like the vessels do. The tracheids ends
overlap with each other, with pairs of pits present. The pit pairs allow water
to pass horizontally from cell to cell.

Phloem
    </title>
    <para id="import-auto-id1167819540765">
Phloem tissue is responsible for translocation which is the transport of soluble
organic substances - for example, sugar. The substances travel along sieve
elements but other types of cells are also present, the companion cells,
parenchyma cells and fibres. Phloem is living tissue. The end walls, unlike
vessel members in xylem, do not have large openings. The end walls, however,
are full of small pores where cytoplasm extends from cell to cell. These porous
connections are called sieve plates. In spite of the fact that their cytoplasm
is actively involved in the conduction of food materials, sieve-tube members do
not have nuclei at maturity. The activity of the sieve tubes is controlled by
companion cells through plasmadesmata.
